INVALID,1001,Old Age Security (OAS) Benefits,"The Old Age Security (OAS) pension is a monthly payment available to most Canadians 65 years of age who meet the Canadian legal status and residence requirements. In addition to the Old Age Security pension, there are three types of Old Age Security benefits:  the Guaranteed Income Supplement, Allowance and Allowance for the Survivor. The OAS provides financial support to millions of seniors, including those that are low-income, each year.

- The volume reflected in the 'Number of Automatic Enrolments' column represents the volume of Automatic Enrolment into the OAS basic pension and the GIS.
- The volume reflected in the 'Applications through Other Channels' column represents the volume of the Automatic Renewal of income-tested benefits through the CRA for the GIS.
- Applications to OAS pension benefits do not constitute the largest volume of work done by the OAS program. In addition to applications, there were also another 3,143,898 OAS and foreign benefit account revisions in 2022-2023.
- OAS and CPP telephone enquiries are managed through the same Pensions Toll-free service, with significant overlap between the two programs on many calls. The metrics reported for CPP and OAS,  such as the volume of calls, are therefore identical and are non-cumulative (i.e. they are not to be added together).""
