For more details contact ic.bnadoptionne.ic@canada.ca.\n\nTo validate a Business Number associated with a charity, departments can access the List of Charities basic search on the Canada.ca website. Enter the Charity name and click the Search button. Then click the Charity name of the search result to find additional information about the charity (e.g., Charity Program number, charity status, effective date of status, designation, etc.) Legal name and operating name cannot be validated using this basic search.\n\nA business number is issued when an organization is registered federally, provincially or municipally.
